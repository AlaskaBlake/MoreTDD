For Professor Hartman,
I did this while in a car ride and did not have internet access. I took a screen shot of the string calculator kata that we did in class 
and am uploading the files now that I have internet. I saw the you asked for commits after each test was written but due to not having 
internet I could not push the changes everytime a new test was added. I spent about an hour doing this kata.
